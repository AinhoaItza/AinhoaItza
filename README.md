## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I'm Ainhoa from Spain and Iâ€™m currently studying Web Development at university, where Iâ€™m building a solid foundation in creating and managing web applications. In addition, Iâ€™m participating in a coding workshop called SheCodes to further enhance my skills and apply my knowledge practically. This workshop offers additional learning opportunities and allows me to work on diverse projects in my free time.
